SQLite3-D

Only two files:
* sqlite3_bindings.d - binding for most recent version of SQLite
* sqlite3.d - OO wrapper

I plan to support bindings for next versions of SQLite. Currently
it's mostly untested - only functions needed for OO wrapper was tested.

OO wrapper support all basic operations - database open, change content, select values.

I implemented prepare/bind interface, please use it - it is handy and protects from
SQL errors and attacks.

Currently very small subset of SQLite3 features used - I just do not know what is
really needed and what is not. Over time I plan to add other fetures thatI (or other people)
will need.

And if you think that somesing must be done differently - don't hesitate - clone,
edit and send pull requests :-)
